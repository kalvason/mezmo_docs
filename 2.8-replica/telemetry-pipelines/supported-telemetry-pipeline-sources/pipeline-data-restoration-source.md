## Description

Use this Source for a Pipeline where you want to be able to [restore telemetry data](/telemetry-pipelines/archive-restore-data) from an archive location. For example, if you have a Pipeline that is built specifically for data analysis, you could use this Source as part of that Pipeline for data that may need to be restored and reviewed at a later date.

## Configuration

There are no configuration options to set. Add the Source to your Pipeline, and then deploy the Pipeline. When you need to restore data to the Pipeline, you will see the Pipeline listed with the other Pipelines where you have added this Source.
