## Resolving Failed Payments

For self service accounts on paid plans where a credit card on file is no longer valid, Mezmo follows this procedure.

1. Attempt billing. If failed, go to next step.
2. Wait 1 day. Retry billing. If failed, go to next step.
3. Wait 5 days. Retry billing. If failed, go to next step.
4. Wait 7 days. Retry billing. If failed, paywall is implemented on the account. Go to next step.
5. Wait until the end of the month. Retry billing. If failed, account will be downgraded to the free plan. Data ingested will no longer be saved.
