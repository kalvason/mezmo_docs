The [Mezmo Docker container](https://github.com/logdna/logspout) lets you send logs from Docker, Docker Cloud, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and other Docker-based platforms. The container automatically collects logs generated by other containers running on the host and sends them to Mezmo's ingestion servers. The container is based on [Logspout](https://hub.docker.com/r/logdna/logspout/) and supports custom metadata, such as a custom hostname and tags.

To learn how to send logs from orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Rancher, see [the Kubernetes documentation page](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/mezmo-agent-v2-for-kubernetes-beta).

{% callout type="info" title="Setting Logging Outputs" %}
As part of your container logging strategy, all of your containers should log to STDOUT and STDERR (standard output). Not only is this required for Logspout to work, but Docker itself expects containers to log to these outputs. Logging your containers to standard output is both a best practice and essential for the Logspout container to function.
