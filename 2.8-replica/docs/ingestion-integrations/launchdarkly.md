The LaunchDarkly integration for Mezmo sends and aggregates LaunchDarkly audit log events in Mezmo. This integration is set up from within the LaunchDarkly web interface, but you will need to [log in to the Mezmo Web App ](https://app.mezmo.com/)and get your **Ingestion Key** to use in the integration set up. [The LaunchDarkly documentation for the Mezmo integration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations/logdna) provides complete set up instructions.
