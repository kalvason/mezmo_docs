Mezmo Log Management enables enterprises to ingest all of their log data to a single platform, optimize it through a [Telemetry Pipeline](/telemetry-pipelines/getting-started-with-mezmo-telemetry-pipeline), and route it to the appropriate teams so that they can take meaningful action in real time.

- Mezmo makes it easy to centralize log data with support for a broad range of [ingestion options](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/ingestion)
- [Automatic](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/log-parsing) and [Custom Parsing](/docs/parse-logs-with-custom-templates) lets you shape log data to become more actionable
- Powerful [Exclusion Rules](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/excluding-log-lines) let you prioritize the right log data for routing; while [Variable Retention](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/variable-retention) allows for finer granularity in prioritizing certain log types over others
- [Alerts](/docs/add-alerts-to-views) can be configured using a number of integrations, including [PagerDuty](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/pagerduty-alert-integration), [Slack](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/slack-alert-integration), and more.
- With [Spike Protection features](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/manage-usage), you can set dynamic thresholds and alerts when data volume limits are being hit
- [Archive](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/archiving) log data to longer term storage for compliance purposes, and use [Restoration](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/data-restoration) to bring log data back to the Mezmo UI

Mezmo provides this level of control on a platform that is loved by customers for its speed, ease of use, and scale. The platform provides flexibility, regardless of the other tools they are using in their observability and security stacks, and gives them more control over their logging spend without sacrificing log data quality.
