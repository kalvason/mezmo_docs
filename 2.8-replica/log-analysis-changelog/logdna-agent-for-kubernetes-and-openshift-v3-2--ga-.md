## Release Notes

## June 21, 2021

LogDNA is pleased to announce the generally available (GA) release of the LogDNA Agent for Kubernetes and OpenShift, version 3.2.

LogDNA Agent runs on Kubernetes (version 1.9 or later) or Red Hat OpenShift (version 4.5 or later). For more detailed information about the LogDNA Agent for Kubernetes  and Openshift, refer to the documentation in our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/logdna/logdna-agent-v2).

## New features and enhancements

- Using regex (regular expression) patterns, you can define rules to redact certain parts of log lines (such as sensitive PII data) before they leave the environment or premises. You can also use regex patterns to include _only_ specific lines, or exclude specific lines, and further control the log data that you want to send to LogDNA. For details, read our [documentation about using regex patterns](https://github.com/logdna/logdna-agent-v2/blob/3.2/docs/README.md#configuring-regex-for-redaction-and-exclusion-or-inclusion) and our library of common [regex patterns](https://github.com/logdna/logdna-agent-v2/blob/3.2/docs/REGEX.md).
