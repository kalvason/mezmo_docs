In this workshop, you will gain control over your OpenTelemetry logs, metrics, and traces.  Learn how Mezmoâ€™s platform helps you build dynamic, "responsive" pipelines that adapt to various conditions by routing comprehensive data during incidents while optimizing for cost during normal operations.  Ensuring your data is in the right place precisely when you need it, reducing MTTR, saving on observability spend, and empowering your teams with intelligent telemetry routing.  Get hands-on experience directing and controlling OpenTelemetry data across your observability systems.
