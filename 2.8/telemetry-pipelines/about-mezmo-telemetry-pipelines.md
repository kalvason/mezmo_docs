Mezmo Telemetry Pipeline enables organizations to take a new approach towards managing telemetry data. 

- Incorporate data from your existing Log Analysis environment, or from entirely new data streams like [auto$](/telemetry-pipelines/kinesis-firehose-source), and the [auto$](/telemetry-pipelines/mezmo-agent-source) to capture a diverse range of telemetry data, with new sources being added regularly
- You can use Processors to [encrypt](/telemetry-pipelines/encrypt-fields-processor), [filter](/telemetry-pipelines/filter-by-field-processor), [route](/telemetry-pipelines/route-processor), and automate other transformations of your data to to make sure that it is tailored to your specific needs for storage and analysis
- Send your processed data to destinations like [auto$](/telemetry-pipelines/s3-destination), [auto$](/telemetry-pipelines/elasticsearch-destination), and [auto$](/telemetry-pipelines/mezmo-destination) so you always know that you will have the data you need in the right place at the right time
- Use  [Pipeline Taps](/telemetry-pipelines/monitor-data-pipelines) to monitor the flow of data in your Pipeline, and [sample Pipeline data in real-time](/telemetry-pipelines/view-pipeline-data) to use in constructing new Pipelines
