You can sign up for free Telemetry Pipeline Trial using the link: [https://www.mezmo.com/sign-up-pipeline-today](https://www.mezmo.com/sign-up-pipeline-today). 

When you sign up for a free trial of Mezmo Telemetry Pipeline, you have access to all the [Source](/telemetry-pipelines/set-up-pipeline-sources), [Destinations](/telemetry-pipelines/set-up-pipeline-destinations), and [Processors](/telemetry-pipelines/set-up-pipeline-processors) components for building Pipelines, as well as the ability to build up to 20 Pipelines. When the 30 day free trial expires, your account will be converted to the Community Edition, which limits the monthly volume of ingress and egress data you can send through your Pipeline. 

## Data Ingress and Egress Limits

During the free trial period, and in the Enterprise edition of Mezmo Telemetry Pipeline, you have unlimited data ingress and egress. With the Community Edition, there is a [monthly limit of 10GB of data](/telemetry-pipelines/monitor-data-pipelines) for both ingress and egress. When this limit is reached, all your active Pipelines will be paused until the beginning of the next monthly cycle, and you will see them listed as **Paused** within the Mezmo Web App user interface. 

## Upgrading to the Enterprise Edition

During your 30 day free trial period, you will see a **Free Trial** badge above your Organization name in the Mezmo Web App user interface. When your free trial ends, this badge will change to **Trial Expired**. To upgrade to the Enterprise Edition during your free trial, or after it expires, click the **Upgrade** button next to the badge. After you confirm that you are interested in an upgrade, a member of the Mezmo Sales Engineering team will be in touch with you to discuss plan options.
