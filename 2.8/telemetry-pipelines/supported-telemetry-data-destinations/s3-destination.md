## [Description](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/amazon-s3-storage-pipeline-destination#description)

Typically you would send data to an AWS S3 bucket for long-term storage, or to send a subset of the data to a database. By sending your data through a Mezmo Pipeline before sending it to S3, you can [encrypt](/telemetry-pipelines/encrypt-fields-processor) sensitive data, [remove fields](/telemetry-pipelines/drop-fields-processor) you don't need to store, and [compact](/telemetry-pipelines/compact-fields-processor) values to make sure the data youâ€™re storing is complete for easy retrieval and rehydration in case you need it later.
