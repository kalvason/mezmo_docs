## Description

The Blackhole Destination drops all data sent to it. This is useful when you are building as Pipeline and want to test the data processing in [a simulation](/telemetry-pipelines/simulate-pipeline-data-flows) without sending the data to a Production Destination.

{% callout type="info" title="No Charge for Blackhole Data" %}
Data that is sent to a Blackhole Destination isn't added to your billable egress volume.
{% /callout %}
