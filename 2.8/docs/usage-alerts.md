You can set usage alerts to notify you and other members of your organization when your usage exceeds a set threshold before the end of your usage cycle. 

If you have a Professional or Enterprise account, the usage cycle is the same as your billing cycle. If you have a Community account, the usage cycle is based on the when your account was created, and runs in a 30 day cycle. You can check when your usage cycle ends and begins in the Enterprise Dashboard. Each chart includes a marker that indicates the end and beginning of the cycle, as shown in this example.
