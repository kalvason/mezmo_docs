## Screens

Screens display Widgets that display metrics about logs over a period. These are useful are to analyze and present log data. In topics in this section you'll learn how to create Screens for specific use cases, while Mezmo also provides pre-defined [auto$](/docs/using-templates) for a variety of log data types.

1. [](/docs/web-analytics-screen)
2. [auto$](/docs/server-analytics-screen)
3. [auto$](/docs/server-security-screen)

To access Screens and Widgets in the Mezmo Web App, go to [Screen](https://app.logdna.com/screens/new-screen)s.

## Widgets

Widgets are added to Screens to display log metrics. 

There are four different widget types:

- **Count** - Displays a single aggregate number.
- **Gauge** - Displays a count out of a minimum and maximum value using a gauge indicator.
- **Table** - Displays a horizontal bar chart with logs grouped by a selectable field.
- **Time Shifted Graph** - Displays a layered line graph comparing values over two different periods. For example, log volume today vs. log volume yesterday.

To get even more ideas on how to use widgets, check out [](/docs/widget-use-cases).

## Feature Notes

- Screens can only accommodate a certain number of widgets. Click and drag widgets to adjust size or create a new Screen.
