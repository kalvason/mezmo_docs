Use the [Mezmo Browser Logger integration](https://github.com/logdna/logdna-browser) combined with this Template to get trends and break down browser-side errors by error message, OS, browser version and more. The Browser Logger Template consists of a collection of pre-configured Views, Boards, and Screens to help you gain insights from your log data.
