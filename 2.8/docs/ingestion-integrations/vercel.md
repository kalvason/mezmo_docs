Vercel has created [a Mezmo integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/logdna) that you can set up as a Vercel Add-on and start streaming Vercel logs immediately. To set up the integration you will need to log in to the Mezmo Web App and find your syslog port URL. Alternatively, you can also set up a custom syslog port for streaming your Vercel logs.

1. Log in to the [Mezmo Web App](https://app.mezmo.com/).
2. In the bottom section of the left-hand navigation, click **Help**.
3. Select **Add Log Sources**. 
4. Under **Via Syslog**, click **syslog**. 
5. Note the SysLog URL to use in setting up the Vercel integration.

Be aware that it can take up to 30 minutes before your logs start coming after the Syslog port has been set up and added to Vercel. Please contact our support team if you're having issues with your Syslog port.
