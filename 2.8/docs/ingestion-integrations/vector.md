Mezmo ingests observability data from Vector pipelines through a Mezmo output sink. To set up the Vector integration, you will need to [install Vector on the platform](https://vector.dev/docs/setup/installation/) you want to monitor if you havenâ€™t already done so, then [set up a Mezmo Sink Configuration file](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/logdna/).
