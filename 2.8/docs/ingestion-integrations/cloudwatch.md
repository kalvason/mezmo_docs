The Mezmo Amazon [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) integration uses AWS [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/index.html) to process and transform your CloudWatch log data, and then routes your logs from CloudWatch to Mezmo.

For more detailed information about the Mezmo Cloudwatch integration, refer to [the documentation in our public GitHub repository](https://github.com/logdna/logdna-cloudwatch).
