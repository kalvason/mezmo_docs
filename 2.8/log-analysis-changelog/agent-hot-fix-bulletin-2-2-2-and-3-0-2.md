## Summary

This hotfix (patch release versions 2.2.2 and 3.0.2) includes code to resolve known issues with the LogDNA Agent for Kubernetes and OpenShift.

## Filesystem Storage Issue

- ## How was the issue manifested?

After a log file was deleted, the agent held a descriptor to the file preventing the storage on the filesystem to be freed.

- ## What was the resolution?

We added additional handling to make sure internal references to the file descriptor are dropped.

## Spurious errors from the Kubernetes API

- ## How was the issue manifested?

Previously when the Kubernetes event endpoint returned a "too old resource version‚Äù error the agent would panic and restart in order to ensure its internal state was valid.

- ## What was the resolution?

The agent will now automatically repopulate its state when it encounters this error.
