Mezmo is pleased to announce the release of several new features for our log management, processing, and analysis platform.

## Variable Retention

Variable Retention allows users to retain logs in the Mezmo user interface (UI) for only as long as they are relevant and then to archive them for long-term storage. This helps reduce total cost of operation while ensuring that users have the right information when they need it.

For more information, check out [the Variable Retention topic](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/variable-retention) in our documentation.

## Enterprise Organizations

Enterprise Organizations is a suite of features that gives Mezmo users with large deployment scenarios more control and the ability to fine-tune their enterprise account setup.

For more information, check out [the Enterprise Organizations topics](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/manage-enterprise-organizations) in our documentation.

## Usage Quotas and Index Rate Alerting

You can now set gigabyte-based usage thresholds on a per-day basis in addition to a per-month basis. More importantly, when users hit set percentages of their limit, they can now elect to start excluding logs from being stored in Mezmo.

For more information, check out [the Usage Quota topic](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/usage-quotas) and [the Index Rate Alerting topic](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/index-rate-alerts) in our documentation.

## Log Data Restoration

Log Data Restoration lets you store your logs more cost-effectively in cold storage, and then recall them back into LogDNA when needed.
