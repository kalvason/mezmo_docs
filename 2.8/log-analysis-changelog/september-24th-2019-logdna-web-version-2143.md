## Added

Updated syslog ingestion instructions.
We added a new banner for LogDNA announcements regarding features, releases, and outages.


##  Bugs

When navigating back to logviewer from a settings page, logviewer stops auto-scrolling to bottom if in live mode. The fix includes logviewer being re-initialized in live mode when navigating back to it.
Live tail sometimes turns on unexpectedly, we fixed that.


## Enhancements

Log viewer performance improvements for chrome v77.
Restricted archiving operations to admins and owners.
Restricted billing details to account owner only.
Manage categories now available for member role.
Improve precision of the y-axis on the manage usage dashboard so usage can be visualized more clearly.
