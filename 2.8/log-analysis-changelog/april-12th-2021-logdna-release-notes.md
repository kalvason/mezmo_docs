## LogDNA Web Application, version 4.83.6

### Fixed Issues
* We fixed several issues in the UI:
* HTML was not rendered properly in a modal box. [LOG-9335]
* the popup element for zoom and search that displays when you hover over a line in the log viewer was remaining on screen and bouncing as new log lines were ingested. [LOG-9104]
