##  Bugs
Our [alerts](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/views) link to the timestamp of the alert that triggered it.  However, many logs share the same timestamp, therefore, causing the alert to implicitly link to the first timestamped logline instead of the actual triggering line.  This bug has been solved.

## Enhancements
CloudWatch (Lambda Function) Documentation Updated
Cloudwatch setup instructions during onboarding and post onboarding have been [updated](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/cloudwatch).
