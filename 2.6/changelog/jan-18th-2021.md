## Fixed Issues

- Fixed an issue in which clicking on the examples provided in the **Jump to Timeframe" tooltip did not work as expected, or worked only intermittently. ([LOG-8457)

- Fixed an issue where the "Go to" option for a selected line didn't work if the line was outside of rendered lines. (LOG-8453)

- When log viewer contrast was set to light mode, toolbar and controls screens were in light mode while everything else was dark. With this fix, screens are restricted to dark mode only. (LOG-8459)

- Updated the LogDNA copyright year.
