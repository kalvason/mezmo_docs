##  Bugs

Users can bypass paywall by navigating to “Manage Billing”, we fixed this bug.
Searching &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; to &lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; (today’s date), returns results all the way up to retention date, fixed this bug.

## Enhancements

Live tail updates that enhances how live tail will pause or start depending on scroll.
Updated the way we calculate Top App usage, instead of doing average percentage, we now calculate an actual percentage of total usage.
Remove "Add x" buttons from filter dropdown menus because no one uses these anyways.
