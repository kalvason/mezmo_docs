You can now use Mezmo’s Node.js library (version 3.0.1+) to log your client-side JavaScript applications to Mezmo. The library sends logs directly from your end users to Mezmo’s ingestion servers, so you can collect vital operational and debugging information without having to print logs to the console. The library offers a complete feature set including multiple log levels, customizable metadata, and the ability to add tags.
