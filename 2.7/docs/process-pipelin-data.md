One of the most important functions of a telemetry pipeline is the ability to process log data to reduce its size, re-format and standardize it, or extract information from it for use in analytical operations. Mezmo Telemetry Pipelines include processors for an extensive set of use cases, that can be used independently for basic processing, or chained together for more complex operations. In this section you'll find a complete listing of Mezmo Pipeline Processors, including their common use cases and configuration.
