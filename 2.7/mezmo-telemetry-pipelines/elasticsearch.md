## [Description](https://docs.mezmo.com/docs/elasticsearch-pipeline-destination#description)

Typically you would use ElasticSearch to store and analyze large amounts of data which are of different structures and formats. An ElasticSearch cluster is composed of **Clusters**, **Indices**, **Nodes**, and **Shards** that help organize and manage how your data is stored. The data can then be efficiently and powerfully searched and analyzed.

ElasticSearch is usually used as a Pipeline destination when your log data needs to be indexed for searching. By setting up a Pipeline for your ElasticSearch data, you can use Pipeline Processors like [Dedupe](/docs/dedupe-pipeline-processor) and [Remove Fields](/docs/remove-fields-pipeline-processor) to clean data or drop it if itâ€™s not valuable before sending it to ElasticSearch.
