## Step 1: Clone the OpenTelemetry Demo

As we are using a modified version of the OpenTelemetry Demo with expanded logs we will need to: clone the repo, modify the config, and then build from scratch.

Run `git clone https://github.com/braxtonj/opentelemetry-demo` into a folder of your choice.

## Step 2: Configure `mezmo-otel-config-extras.yml` with Shared Source Credentials

Grab the URL and saved Access Keys from your Log, Metric and Trace Shared Sources (don't worry, if you didn't save the key you can always create a new one).  Modify [opentelemetry-demo/mezmo-otel-config-extras.yml](https://github.com/braxtonj/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/mezmo-otel-config-extras.yml) with the proper credentials and save.  Note that Log, Metrics and Traces will each have their own unique URL and Access Keys.

## Step 3: Build and Run the OpenTelmetry Demo

To easily build from scratch, simply run the convenience script `sh run.sh` from the demo's root folder.  This will build all necessary resources and deploy the demo to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

Note that it may take up to **15 minutes** to build the demo from scratch the first time.  Recommend starting this and then continuing on with the workship while things build and deploy.
