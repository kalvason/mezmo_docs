Mezmo will be moving to a new platform provider shortly, and the IP addresses of our API endpoints will also change. The list of new addresses for the Mezmo services are below.

_Note that our cutover is driven by a domain name system change (DNS), and does not require you to update your agent configuration. The new addresses are important only if you have configured outbound IP-based filtering in your firewalls, otherwise, this change should be transparent for all customers._
