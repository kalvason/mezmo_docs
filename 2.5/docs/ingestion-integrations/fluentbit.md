Fluent Bit has developed a Mezmo output plugin that enables you to set up an integration with Mezmo by creating a new Fluent Bit configuration file. You can find complete instructions and an example file in [the Fluent Bit documentation for the Mezmo output plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna). You will need to [log in to the Mezmo Web App](https://app.mezmo.com/) to get your **Ingestion Key** to complete the configuration.
