## What is the difference between boards vs. screens?

**Boards** are a collection of graphs. Typically you use this to aggregate metrics about your log lines or query or _plots_ over time. Each data point on your graph coincides with a log line so you can actually click-in to understand where that datapoint is coming from.

**Graphs** can be displayed as

- a line graph
- a histogram
- a pie graph

In our UI, we call histograms and pie graphs as _breakdowns_

**Screens** is a dashboard of configurable widgets to display metrics about your logs. Widgets include:

- counts (single number aggregation)
- gauge (count with a gauge indicator)
- table (list of aggregations)
- time shifted graph (layered line graph of offset time intervals).

Typically screens is a great way to present high level, comprehensive metrics to managers, leadership, or your entire organization.
