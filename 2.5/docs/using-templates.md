Mezmo provides templates for commonly used queries, so that you can quickly add Views, Boards and Screens for those specific queries.

Browse the [full library](https://app.logdna.com/manage/template-library) of Mezmo Templates , select which templates you want, and then click on **Get Started** to download and import the template.

After importing the templates you want, they will automatically appear in your Mezmo web application, under your Views, Boards, and Screens.

You can at any time go back to the Template Library and click **Edit** on any template that you have already downloaded in order to modify which Views, Boards, and Screens you want to install, or remove them.



{% callout type="info" title="Note" %}
Note that if you have already modified any of the Views, Boards, Screens, parsing templates, or exclusion rules that were installed from a template, you will need to remove each of the modified items manually.
